### Purpose:
- Saves your window session (Firefox tabs)
- Allows you to reload all tabs from your prior session(s) (including incognito)

### Future
- Allows user defined polling for session saving (every x amount of minutes -> save session)
- Tagging sessions and saving them as records with a web view for inspecting sessions rather than temporary objects
- Deleting individual web addresses from saved sessions
